@article{Shuster1981,
	Abstract = {Two computationally efficient algorithms are presented for determining three-axis attitude from two or more vector observations. The first of these, the TRIAD algorithm, provides a deterministic (i.e., nonoptimal) solution for the attitude based on two vector observations. The second, the QUEST algorithm, is an optimal algorithm which determines the attitude that achieves the best weighted overlap of an arbitrary number of reference and observation vectors. Analytical expressions are given for the covariance matrices for the two algorithms using a fairly realistic model for the measurement errors. The mathematical relationship of the two algorithms and their relative merits are discussed and numerical examples are given. The advantage of computing the covariance matrix in the body frame rather than in the inertial frame (e.g., in terms of Euler angles) is emphasized. These results are valuable when a single-frame attitude must be computed frequently. They will also be useful to the mission analyst or spacecraft engineer for the evaluation of launch-window constraints or of attitude accuracies for different attitude sensor configurations.},

After a brief review of the techniques and approaches already available in literature, we recall the Free Form Deformation parametrization, a technique which proved to be efficient and at the same time versatile, allowing to manage complex shapes even with few parameters. We tested and studied the FFD technique by establishing a path, from the geometry definition, to the method implementation, and finally to the simulation and to the optimization of the shape. In particular, we have studied a bulb and a rudder of a race sailing boat as model applications, where we have tested a  complete procedure from Computer-Aided-Design to build the geometrical model to discretization and mesh generation.},

abstract="This paper exposes a very geometrical yet directly computational way of working with conformal motions in 3D. With the increased relevance of conformal structures in architectural geometry, and their traditional use in CAD, its results should be useful to designers and programmers. In brief, we exploit the fact that any 3D conformal motion is governed by two well-chosen point pairs: the motion is composed of (or decomposed into) two specific orthogonal circular motions in planes determined by those point pairs. The resulting orbit of a point is an equiangular spiral on a Dupin cyclide. These results are compactly expressed and programmed using conformal geometric algebra (CGA), and this paper can serve as an introduction to its usefulness. Although the point pairs come in different kinds (imaginary, real, tangent vector, direction vector, axis vector and `flat point'), causing the great variety of conformal motions, all are unified both algebraically and computationally as 2-blades in CGA, automatically producing properly parametrized simple rotors by exponentiation. An additional advantage of using CGA is its covariance: conformal motions for other primitives such as circles are computed using exactly the same formulas, and hence the same software operations, as motions of points. This generates an interesting class of easily generated shapes, like spatial circles moving conformally along a knot on a Dupin cyclide.",

	abstract="A common need in machine vision is to compute the 3-D rigid body transformation that aligns two sets of points for which correspondence is known. A comparative analysis is presented here of four popular and efficient algorithms, each of which computes the translational and rotational components of the transform in closed form, as the solution to a least squares formulation of the problem. They differ in terms of the transformation representation used and the mathematical derivation of the solution, using respectively singular value decomposition or eigensystem computation based on the standard {\$}[ {\backslash}vec{\{}R{\}}, {\backslash}vec{\{}T{\}} ]{\$}representation, and the eigensystem analysis of matrices derived from unit and dual quaternion forms of the transform. This comparison presents both qualitative and quantitative results of several experiments designed to determine (1) the accuracy and robustness of each algorithm in the presence of different levels of noise, (2) the stability with respect to degenerate data sets, and (3) relative computation time of each approach under different conditions. The results indicate that under ``ideal'' data conditions (no noise) certain distinctions in accuracy and stability can be seen. But for ``typical, real-world'' noise levels, there is no difference in the robustness of the final solutions (contrary to certain previously published results). Efficiency, in terms of execution time, is found to be highly dependent on the computer system setup.",

  abstract={The authors solve the problem of estimating the best rotation aligning two sets of corresponding vectors (also known as Wahba's problem or point cloud registration). The proposed method is among the fastest methods reported in recent literatures, moreover it is robust to noise, accurate and simpler than most other methods. It is based on solving the linear equations derived from the formulation of the problem in Euclidean Geometric Algebra. The authors show its efficiency in two applications: the as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) surface modelling and the more smooth rotation enhanced ARAP mesh animation which is the only method capable of deforming surface modes with quality of tetrahedral models. Mesh deformation is a key technique in games, automated construction and robotics. The ARAP technique along with its improved variants, although have been extensively studied, can still not be achieved efficiently. Linear geometric algebra based rotor solution proposed in this study gives another perspective of the kernel problem. This, however, not only improves the real performance of the three-dimensional mesh deformation, but also provides a brand new computationally efficient solution to the Wahba's problem and point cloud registration, which has been closely related to the automation science and engineering.},
